Milestone 1:
    Week 1 concept: Reading from files
    Create a skeleton of classes and methods

Water Usage Calculator (inputs) - Dorm life specific
    Aspects of usage:
    Drinking Water - allow users to input ounces or milliliters
    Showering - time spent in the shower (assume dorm showers)
    Using the Bathroom - most toilets here are water conserving,
                         single drop flush (less)
                         multiple drop flush (more)
    Laundry - low,medium,high soil (assume the use of dorm speed queens)
    Sink usage (assume a dorm styled sink):
        Washing hands
        dishes
    Other data
    date

Water Usage Calculator data
    Need to collect data on the flow rates of certain hardware to create an accurate calulator
    Store in a file (.txt or .csv)
    Can I upload a file that keeps track of updating water usage benchmarks? An external data file that automatically updates

Water Usage Calculator (outputs) - Dorm life specific
    Total usage
    Personalized insights
        Usage in percentages by type of usage
        Benchmark comparisons from the average wake forest student, NC, the US, global standards
    Tips for water conservation based on usage

Storing Data
    Use file writer to create a .txt or .csv file to store the users data.
    The program can then read the file to access data when needed

Milestone 2:
    Concept 2: Recursion and Classes

What I want to add
    Store multiple entries per user
    How can I incorporate recursion?
        - view their past water usage data recursively
